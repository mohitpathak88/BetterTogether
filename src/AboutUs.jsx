      <h5>Have you ever dreamt of living in a better world? A world that is free from poverty, hunger and disease. We all have wished at some point in our lives that we were powerful enough to change the world, without realizing that we have always possessed that power. As motivated individuals, we aspire to make a positive difference in the lives of ordinary people by working for the betterment of society. The purpose of our project is to help people find NGOs that are not well decorated on the web or very hard to find. ‘Giving’ is not just an act, it holds a much deeper meaning in the lives of both the giver and the receiver. An act of giving and sharing not only transforms one as a human being, but also helps the less fortunate to lead a better life. Apart from understanding the importance of giving, it’s equally important to understand how to contribute in a way that benefits the needy in the best possible manner. When you donate to charity, you lend a significant helping hand in bringing about the welfare of communities with limited means. Contributing to an NGO that works to provide health and nutrition, education and protection to children is the right step ahead in enabling the society to achieve the required socio-economic growth.</h5>
